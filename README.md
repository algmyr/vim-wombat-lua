# vim-wombat-lua
I've used some flavor of Wombat for ages and have needed to make tweaks and updates to it over time.
At some point I decided to do a full rewrite to lua, maintaining most colors and generalizing things
a bit.

Mostly extended through "this thing looks bad, let me fix it" so it's likely that specific plugins
might look bad. But if the plugins fallback to one of the builtin highlighting groups things
should behave decently.

Uses color buddy since that seemed convenient at the time, no clue if it's good practice nowadays or
if there is some new fancy library for this.
